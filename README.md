Working with the Theme
=================================

You can use the theme in two distinct ways.

1. **Manage the theme using Composer** and update using `composer update`. This method should be used if you are using the theme for prototyping and do not need to edit the theme files directly.

2. Use the theme as a starting point for your own custom theme. In this case, you're best off **installing with git and committing changes to your git repo**.

Composer Installation
=================================

`"require": { "rywa/silverstripe-foundation": "1.0.*" }`

Add `themes/foundation` to your `.gitignore`

Git Installation
=================================

`cd themes`

`git clone git://github.com/ryanwachtl/silverstripe-foundation.git foundation`

`rm -rf .git` (optional, to remove existing git repo)

Enable Theme
=================================

```
SSViewer:
  theme: 'foundation'
```

in `/mysite/_config/config.yml`

Requirements
=================================

[SilverStripe](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework) 3.1.x

Recommended
=================================

While not required, you'll get the best experience with this theme by installing the `foundationforms` module below. The Foundation Forms module is also compatible with, and makes a great companion to, the [User Forms module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-userforms).

The Gist linked below is a custom Editor Config that I use. It is a single line of buttons with Foundation specific styles.

About Foundation
=================================

Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. With Foundation you can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device, with tons of included layout constructs (like a full responsive grid), elements and best practices.
