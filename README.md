SilverStripe Foundation Theme
=================================

The fastest way to get up and running with the Foundation framework in your SilverStripe project!

A prototyping theme based on ZURB Foundation, current version 4.3.1

Theme Demo
=================================

http://silverstripe-foundation.rywa.us/

Installing with Git
=================================

`git clone git://github.com/ryanwachtl/silverstripe-foundation.git foundation`

Installing with Composer
=================================

`"require": { "rywa/silverstripe-foundation": "4.3.*" }`

If you install with composer and would like to edit or build off of the theme you should copy the directory and rename. Otherwise, running `composer update` will overwrite your files. For the next major release (Foundation 5) I'm working on refactoring the theme/module to better support making Foundation available within your project and updatable with composer.

Requirements
=================================

[SilverStripe](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework) 3.0 or 3.1

Recommended
=================================

[SilverStripe Zurb Foundation Forms Module](https://github.com/ryanwachtl/silverstripe-foundation-forms)

About Foundation
=================================

Foundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. With Foundation you can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device, with tons of included layout constructs (like a full responsive grid), elements and best practices.
